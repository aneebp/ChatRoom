## How to Set Up and Run Locally ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites

- Python (3.x)
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- Cloudinary account (for media storage)
- Render account (for deployment, if required)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/studybuddy.git
   cd studybuddy
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure PostgreSQL (for production)**:

   - Set up a PostgreSQL database.
   - Update your `settings.py` file with the PostgreSQL configuration:

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
           'NAME': 'your_db_name',
           'USER': 'your_db_user',
           'PASSWORD': 'your_db_password',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '5432',
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Run migrations**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Configure Cloudinary for media storage**:

   - Add Cloudinary credentials in your `settings.py` file:

   ```python
   CLOUDINARY_STORAGE = {
       'CLOUD_NAME': 'your_cloud_name',
       'API_KEY': 'your_api_key',
       'API_SECRET': 'your_api_secret',
   }
   DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
   ```

7. **Create a superuser**:

   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. **Run the development server**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

Now, you should be able to access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## CI/CD Implementation üîÑ

StudyBuddy incorporates a basic CI/CD pipeline, where features are staged, tested, and merged into production. This ensures that updates and new features can be reliably added with minimal disruption to the live environment.
